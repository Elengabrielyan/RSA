## RSA Algorithm Implementation

Run `algorithm.py` and it shall give two keys
* Private key - For the owner
* Public key - For rest of the world  


> The algorithm implemented in this repository is based loosely on
the RSA algorithm's implementation in the book `Introduction to Algorithms`, section 31.7
